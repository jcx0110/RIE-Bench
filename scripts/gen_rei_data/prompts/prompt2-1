Some details of {CONFUSE NAME}: He is warm-hearted, a bit of a goofball, but deeply caring. He has a natural curiosity and a love for teaching, which often spills over into his family life. His humor is a bit cheesy, and he often makes corny science jokes, much to his kids' embarrassment. He is a dedicated husband and a father of two. He’s the peacekeeper in the household and often plays the role of the mediator between his kids and his wife when disagreements arise.
