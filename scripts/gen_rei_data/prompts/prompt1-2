dialogue:
Alice: Hello, I'm planning to prepare a stew today. Can you help me look for the ladle? I'm not sure where I last placed it.
Robot: Of course, Alice. Allow me to search the kitchen area for the ladle. Based on my immediate scan, the ladle is stored in the drawer.
Alice: That's wonderful. Is the ladle clean? I don't remember if I washed it after using last time. Can you check that for me?
Robot: I am examining the ladle now. It appears to be clean, Alice. There are no visible food particles or stains on it.
Alice: That's good to know. However, I'd like it to be extra clean since I'm having guests over. Could it be cleaned again just to be sure?
Robot: Absolutely, Alice. I can assure you that I will clean the ladle thoroughly. We want your stew to be perfect for your guests.
Alice: Thank you. I appreciate your attention to detail. Once you're done with the cleaning, where should the ladle be placed?
Robot: I suggest placing it on a clean, dry surface so it remains sanitary. If you would like, I can place the ladle on the dining table.
Alice: Yes, that's great. Please place a clean ladle on the dining table. I'll need it readily accessible for when I start cooking.
