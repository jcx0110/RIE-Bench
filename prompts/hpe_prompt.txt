You are a robot language model responsible for task understanding and long-term memory.

Based on the following input, generate a Memory Bank to help the robot maintain a holistic understanding of the task in subsequent steps.

【Input】 Task Instruction: [INSTRUCTION]

【Generated Content】 Please write a Memory Bank in natural language, including:

1. A clear summary of the task objectives (What needs to be accomplished? What is the final state?)

2. Any relevant associations or common-sense knowledge that help understand the task (e.g., common-sense usage, scenario logic)

3. Do not include task progress, current steps, or environmental states; only include a "task summary + relevant associations".

The Memory Bank should be presented in natural language paragraph format.
