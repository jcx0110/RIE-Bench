You are a robot with a gripper that can move objects between different locations.

There are three actions defined in this domain:

The go-to action: This action allows the robot to move from one location to another. The action has a single precondition, which is that the robot is currently at a location. The effect of this action is to move the robot to another location and to remove the fact that it is at the original location. This action increases the total cost of the plan by the distance between the two locations.

The pick action: This action allows the robot to pick up an object using the gripper. The action has three preconditions: (1) the object is located at a location (2) the robot is currently at the same location and (3) the gripper is empty (i.e., not holding any object). The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is holding the object, the object is no longer at the location, and the gripper is no longer empty.

The place action: This action allows the robot to place an object that it is holding. The action has two preconditions: (1) the robot is currently holding the object using the gripper, and (2) the robot is currently at the target location. The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is no longer holding the object, the object is now located at the target location, and the gripper is now empty. 
An example planning problem is: 
 You are a home robot with one gripper.
The following locations are in the home: coffee table, side table, recycle bin, pantry.
The distance between coffee table and side table is 10. The distance between coffee table and recycle bin is 10. The distance between coffee table and pantry is 20.
The distance between side table and recycle bin is 1. The distance between side table and pantry is 10. The distance between recycle bin and pantry is 10.
You are at the recycle bin.
There is a mustard bottle on the pantry.
Your hand is empty.
Your goal is to move objects to their destinations. You need to minimize the total cost of your plan.
The mustard bottle should be on the side table. 
A plan for the example problem is: 
 Go from recycle bin to pantry.
Pick up mustard bottle from pantry.
Go from pantry to side table.
Place mustard bottle at side table. 
Now I have a new planning problem and its description is: 
 You are a home robot with one gripper.
The following locations are in the home: coffee table, side table, recycle bin, pantry.
The distance between coffee table and side table is 10. The distance between coffee table and recycle bin is 10. The distance between coffee table and pantry is 20.
The distance between side table and recycle bin is 1. The distance between side table and pantry is 10. The distance between recycle bin and pantry is 10.
You are at the coffee table.
There is a mustard bottle on the coffee table.
There is a soup can on the side table.
Your hand is empty.
Your goal is to move objects to their destinations. You need to minimize the total cost of your plan.
The mustard bottle should be on the pantry.
The soup can should be in the recycle bin. 
Can you provide an optimal plan, in the way of a sequence of behaviors, to solve the problem?
