I want you to solve planning problems. An example planning problem is: 
 You are a home robot with one gripper.
The following locations are in the home: coffee table, side table, recycle bin, pantry.
The distance between coffee table and side table is 10. The distance between coffee table and recycle bin is 10. The distance between coffee table and pantry is 20.
The distance between side table and recycle bin is 1. The distance between side table and pantry is 10. The distance between recycle bin and pantry is 10.
You are at the recycle bin.
There is a mustard bottle on the pantry.
Your hand is empty.
Your goal is to move objects to their destinations. You need to minimize the total cost of your plan.
The mustard bottle should be on the side table. 
The problem PDDL file to this problem is: 
 (define (problem manipulation-00)
(:domain manipulation)

Now I have a new planning problem and its description is: 
 You are a home robot with one gripper.
The following locations are in the home: coffee table, side table, recycle bin, pantry.
The distance between coffee table and side table is 10. The distance between coffee table and recycle bin is 10. The distance between coffee table and pantry is 20.
The distance between side table and recycle bin is 1. The distance between side table and pantry is 10. The distance between recycle bin and pantry is 10.
You are at the coffee table.
There is a mustard bottle on the coffee table.
There is a soup can on the side table.
Your hand is empty.
Your goal is to move objects to their destinations. You need to minimize the total cost of your plan.
The mustard bottle should be on the pantry.
The soup can should be in the recycle bin. 
Provide me with the problem PDDL file that describes the new planning problem directly without further explanations? Only return the PDDL file. Do not return anything else.
